# Smart Mirror
Smart Mirror is a prototype project which has been developed in the context of the modules Innovation Project and Smart-Home Practicum in the summersemester of 2016 at Stuttgart Media University. The module was offered by the graduate program Computer Science and Media. 

The Smart Mirror allows the user to display personalized widgets on the mirror for example current weather or actual traffic situation. The data is taken from different open source APIs.

The goal of the module was to realize an innovation project with focus on the technology and architecture. The core component which controls sensors, the frontend and the backend is a Raspberry Pi which will be fit behind the mirror.
